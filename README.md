Library Catalog - A program that manages a library catalog and checkout system.
Library Management System - 3 classes (Book, Library, and Member): Implement a book class that represents a library book, a library class that manages the books, and a member class that represents a library member. Use inheritance and encapsulation to ensure that only authorized users can access the books.

Description:
    The program simulates an online library, using four classes to implement a book, a library, a library member, and a JavaFX user interface. The user of the program can register and login to an account, view the library's books, view the user's selected books, rent and return books, and given administrative access, add and remove books from the library.

Running the file:
    The file will be run through the App.java file, where once ran will be given four options: login, register, view books, and exit program. The user will be prompted to register first, and from there can create a username, password, and restriction level. The restriction level determines the access level of the user from a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 is admin level access. The user can then login, and access the rest of the program. From there, the user can rent and return books, as well as viewing the rest of the library catalog. If the user created an account with admin level access, they can then add and remove books from the library itself. There will be a home button throughout the program that will bring the user back to the main menu when clicked. 
IDE:
    The recommended IDE for this program is the EclipseIDE, however other IDEs such as VSCode or IntelliJ can be used as well.
Java Version:
    The program is built on Java version 8 update 351.
System:
    The program is recommended for the Windows system, and not tested but possibly able to be ran on MAC.
